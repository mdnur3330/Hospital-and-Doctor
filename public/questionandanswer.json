        "question": "Difference between controlled and uncontrolled components?",
        "answer": "In React, a component is called “controlled” when we allow React to take control of it. This means the component manages the input form, and any changes to it are handled entirely by React using event handlers like setState(). Additionally, the component handles rendering and stores the form data within its own state.",

    {
        "question": "Which one is better? Tell us something about useFormStatus() (explore and explain)",
        "answer": "useFormStatus() is a React hook that helps track the status of a form submission, mainly used with Next.js App Router and Server Actions. It provides a pending value, which becomes true while the form is being submitted. This allows you to easily disable the submit button or show a loading message like “Submitting...”. It simplifies code by removing the need for manual useState to track loading. However, it only works within forms using server actions in supported setups like Next.js 13+.",
